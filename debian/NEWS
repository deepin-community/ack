ack (3.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:

  ack 3 no longer highlights capture groups.
  ------------------------------------------

  ack 2 would highlight your capture groups.  For example,

    ack '(set|get)_foo_(name|id)'

  would highlight the `set` or `get`, and the `name` or `id`, but not the
  full `set_user_id` that was matched.

  This feature was too confusing and has been removed.  Now, the entire
  matching string is highlighted.

  ack 3's --output allows fewer special variables
  -----------------------------------------------

  In ack 2, you could put any kind of Perl code in the `--output`
  option and it would get `eval`uated at run time, which would let
  you do tricky stuff like this gem from Mark Fowler
  (http://www.perladvent.org/2014/2014-12-21.html):

    ack --output='$&: @{[ eval "use LWP::Simple; 1" && length LWP::Simple::get($&) ]} bytes' \
                    'https?://\S+' list.txt
    http://google.com/: 19529 bytes
    http://metacpan.org/: 7560 bytes
    http://www.perladvent.org/: 5562 bytes

  This has been a security problem in the past, and so in ack 3 we
  no longer `eval` the contents of `--output`.  You're now restricted
  to the following variables: `$1` thru `$9`, `$_`, `$.`, `$&`, ``$` ``,
  `$'` and `$+`.  You can also embed `\t`, `\n` and `\r` ,
  and `$f` as stand-in for `$filename` in `ack2 --output` .

ack-grep (2.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The program "ack" is no more renamed to "ack-grep" since the conflicting
  "ack", a Kanji code converter, has been removed from Debian (see #662114).

  For a transitional phase of one Debian release, the package will though
  contain symlinks from ack-grep to ack for backwards compatibility.

ack-grep (2.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:  

  ack 2 makes some big changes in its behaviors that could trip up
  users who are used to the idiosyncracies of ack 1.x.  These changes
  could affect your searching happiness, so please read them.

  Read the full list in /usr/share/doc/ack-grep/changelog.gz.
