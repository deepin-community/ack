        <div id="verse-1">
            Stand Navy out to sea, fight our battle cry!
            We'll never change our course so vicious foes steer shy-y-y-y!
            Roll out the TNT, anchors aweigh!
            Sail on to victory, and sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!
        </div>

        <div id="verse-2">
            Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh!
            Farewell to foreign Shores, we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay;
            Through our last night ashore, drink to the foam,
            Until we meet once more, here's wishing you a happy voyage home!
        </div>

        <div id="verse-3">
            Blue of the mighty deep, Gold of God's great sun;
            Let these our colors be, Till All of time be done-n-n-ne;
            On seven seas we learn, Navy's stern call:
            Faith, courage, service true, With honor over, honor over all.
        </div>
