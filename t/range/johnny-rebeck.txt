VERSE
There once was a little Dutchman
His name was Johnny Rebeck
He was a dealer in sauerkraut
And sausages and speck
He was the finest Dutchman
The best you've ever seen
'til one day he invented
A great big sausage machine
Bang!

CHORUS
Oh, Mr. Johnny Rebeck what makes you be so mean?
I told you you'd be sorry for inventing that machine
Now all the neighbors' cats and dogs will nevermore be seen
They'll all be ground to sausages in Johnny Rebeck's machine.
Bang!

VERSE
One night the darn thing busted
The darn thing wouldn't go
So Johnny Rebeck crawled inside
To see what made it so
That night his wife had a nightmare
And walking in her sleep
She turned the crank
And gave it a yank
Pooooor Johnny Rebeck was meat
Bang!
