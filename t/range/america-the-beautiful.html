        <h1>America the Beautiful</h1>

        <div id="verse-1">
            O beautiful for spacious skies,
            For amber waves of grain,
            For purple mountain majesties
            Above the fruited plain!
            America! America!
            God shed His grace on thee
            And crown thy good with brotherhood
            From sea to shining sea!
        </div>

        <div id="verse-2">
            O beautiful for pilgrim feet,
            Whose stern, impassioned stress
            A thoroughfare for freedom beat
            Across the wilderness!
            America! America!
            God mend thine every flaw,
            Confirm thy soul in self-control,
            Thy liberty in law!
        </div>

        <div id="verse-3">
            O beautiful for heroes proved
            In liberating strife,
            Who more than self their country loved
            And mercy more than life!
            America! America!
            May God thy gold refine,
            Till all success be nobleness,
            And every gain divine!
        </div>

        <div id="verse-4">
            O beautiful for patriot dream
            That sees beyond the years
            Thine alabaster cities gleam
            Undimmed by human tears!
            America! America!
            God shed His grace on thee
            And crown thy good with brotherhood
            From sea to shining sea!
